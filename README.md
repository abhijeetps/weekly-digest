## Features

When the Weekly Digest App gets installed in a repository of a user or organization, it curates together the following data and publishes it as an issue:

- Issues created in the last one week
  - Open Issues
  - Closed Issues
  - Noisy Issue
  - Liked Issue
- Pull requests opened, updated, or merged in the last pull request
  - Opened Pull Requests
  - Updated Pull Requests
  - Merged Pull Requests
- Commits made in the master branch, in the last week
- Contributors, adding contributions in the last week
- Stargazers, or the fans of your repositories, who really loved your repo
- Releases, of the project you are working on

The app, as the name suggests, generates these digests and publishes it on weekly basis, typically on a Sunday. 

One can change the default configuration of the app by adding a [_.github/weekly-digest.yml_](docs/configuration.md) file in their GitHub repository, which allows them to configure the publication day and the specific information included in the digest.
